## Changelog
### 23 july 2021
- The web now detects if you upload an old configuration (no modules) or the new one and will stick to that file configuration.
- Although not shown, the modules will be copied with the side you choose (key cluster in the left side and trackpads on the right).
- Unlike the copy function, clearing a side won't unassign the modules.
