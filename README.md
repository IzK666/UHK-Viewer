# UHK Layer cloning

A tool for copying/cloning/erasing layers for [UHK](https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent).
Also, includes some useful tools not included in agent.

You can try it online [here](https://izk666.github.io/UHK-Viewer/), or dowload all the files and run on your computer.


## Tools

- Create new blank keymaps
- Copy/Paste/Clear layers (Left side and right side separately)
- Rename keymaps

- Keys from modules will be copied when a layer is copied (key cluster for left side and trackball for right side), although not shown
- Modules can't be cleared

## Extras

- Colored macros for [Karel's firmware](https://github.com/kareltucek)

## Changelog
### 23 july 2021
- New: File format detection. The web now detects if you upload an old configuration (no modules) or the new one and exports the right format.
- Added: Show the Keymap/Layer that will be copied on each side with the paste button

## To do
- Clone keymap
- Remove keymap
- Edit macros
- Show modules
